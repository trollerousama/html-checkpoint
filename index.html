                <p>Top Secret founder Kazuhiko "Smokey" Nagata drove the car to 222 mph at Italy's Nardo test track after it was converted to V12 power in 2008, but that wasn't his most well-known performance behind the wheel. Smokey took the Supra to the UK in 1999 and claimed a top speed of 197 mph on the A1...in the rain, something that was noted to be highly impressive but highly illegal. He was apprehended and thrown in jail after being pulled over. Smokey Nagata's imprisonment was at Her Majesty's Pleasure, which translates to "we're going to keep you in jail indefinitely."</p>
